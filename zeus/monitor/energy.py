class ZeusMonitor:
    """Measure the GPU energy and time consumption of a block of code.

    Works for multi-GPU and heterogeneous GPU types. Aware of `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
    For instance, if `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3`, GPU index `1` passed into `gpu_indices`
    will be interpreted as CUDA device `3`.

    You can mark the beginning and end of a measurement window, during which the GPU
    energy and time consumed will be recorded. Multiple concurrent measurement windows
    are supported.

    For Volta or newer GPUs, energy consumption is measured very cheaply with the
    `nvmlDeviceGetTotalEnergyConsumption` API. On older architectures, this API is
    not supported, so a separate Python process is used to poll `nvmlDeviceGetPowerUsage`
    to get power samples over time, which are integrated to compute energy consumption.
    Since it is spawning the process, the monitor should not be instantiated as a global variable.
    Python puts a protection to prevent creating a process in global scope.
    Refer to the "Safe importing of main module" section in https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html for more detail.

    ## Integration Example

    ```python
    from zeus.monitor import ZeusMontior

    # Time/Energy measurements for four GPUs will begin and end at the same time.
    gpu_indices = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    monitor = ZeusMonitor(gpu_indices)

    # Mark the beginning of a measurement window. You can use any string
    # as the window name, but make sure it's unique.
    monitor.begin_window("entire_training")

    # Actual work
    training(x, y)

    # Mark the end of a measurement window and retrieve the measurment result.
    result = monitor.end_window("entire_training")

    # Print the measurement result.
    print(f"Training took {result.time} seconds.")
    print(f"Training consumed {result.total_energy} Joules.")
    for gpu_idx, gpu_energy in result.energy.items():
        print(f"GPU {gpu_idx} consumed {gpu_energy} Joules.")
    ```
