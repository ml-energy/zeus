        This method will randomly choose one of the possible training "paths". Then,
        based on cost_ub, it will compute the maximum number of epochs the job can run.
        If the path's target_epoch is smaller than or equal to the maximum number of
        epochs, the cost incurred until target_epoch is returned. Otherwise, the cost
        incurred until the maximum number of epochs is returned.

        It is important to note that the job may never run when the first epoch's cost
        is already expected to exceed the cost upper bound. In such a case, the returned
        time and energy consumptions will be zero. This case must be treated separately
        in the calling code.

        If profile_power is True, the first epoch will JIT-profile power limits coarsely
        by dividing the epoch evenly into len(available_power_limits) pieces. Thus the
        the first epoch's energy and time consumption will be slightly adjusted.

        Args:
            job: Job spec to run.
            batch_size: Batch size to use.
            power_limit: Power limit to use. Regardless of whether this run of this
                batch size requires power profiling, the simulator will input the optimal
                power limit for the batch size. The first epoch energy consumption from
                power profiling is adjusted in the latter half of this method based on the
                profile_power flag.
            rng: Random number generator used to sample one training path.
            cost_ub: Cost upper bound. The job is terminated when the next epoch is going
