**Project News** ⚡ 

- \[2024/02\] Zeus was selected as a [2024 Mozilla Technology Fund awardee](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/open-source-AI-for-environmental-justice/)!
- \[2023/12\] We released Perseus, an energy optimizer for large model training: [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06902) | [Blog](https://ml.energy/zeus/research_overview/perseus) | [Optimizer](https://ml.energy/zeus/optimize/pipeline_frequency_optimizer)
- \[2023/07\] We used the [`ZeusMonitor`](https://ml.energy/zeus/reference/monitor/energy/#zeus.monitor.energy.ZeusMonitor) to profile GPU time and energy consumption for the [ML.ENERGY leaderboard & Colosseum](https://ml.energy/leaderboard).
---

Zeus is a library for (1) [**measuring**](https://ml.energy/zeus/measure) the energy consumption of Deep Learning workloads and (2) [**optimizing**](https://ml.energy/zeus/optimize) their energy consumption.

Zeus is part of [The ML.ENERGY Initiative](https://ml.energy).

## Getting Started

Please refer to our [Getting Started](https://ml.energy/zeus/getting_started) page.
After that, you might look at

- [Measuring Energy](https://ml.energy/zeus/measure)
- [Optimizing Energy](https://ml.energy/zeus/optimize)

### Docker image

We provide a Docker image fully equipped with all dependencies and environments.
Refer to our [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mlenergy/zeus) and [`Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile).

### Examples

We provide working examples for integrating and running Zeus in the [`examples/`](/examples) directory.

## Research

Zeus is rooted on multiple research papers.
Even more research is ongoing, and Zeus will continue to expand and get better at what it's doing.
