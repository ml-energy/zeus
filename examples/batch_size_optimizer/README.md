# Batch Size Optimizer

The batch size optimizer finds the optimal training batch size for DNN jobs that recur over time.
For more details, see the [docs](https://ml.energy/zeus/optimizers/batch_size_optimizer).

- The MNIST example shows single GPU or data parallel training + Kubeflow deployment.
- The Capriccio example shows a slowly drifting sentiment analysis dataset integrated with the batch size optimizer.
