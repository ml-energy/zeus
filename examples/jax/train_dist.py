"""An MNIST example with single-program multiple-data (SPMD) data parallelism.

The aim here is to illustrate how to use JAX's `pmap` to express and execute
SPMD programs for data parallelism along a batch dimension, while also
minimizing dependencies by avoiding the use of higher-level layers and
optimizers libraries.
