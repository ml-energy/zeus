Zeus is a framework for (1) measuring GPU energy consumption and (2) optimizing energy and time for DNN training.

### Measuring GPU energy

```python
from zeus.monitor import ZeusMonitor

monitor = ZeusMonitor(gpu_indices=[0,1,2,3])

monitor.begin_window("heavy computation")
# Four GPUs consuming energy like crazy!
measurement = monitor.end_window("heavy computation")

print(f"Energy: {measurement.total_energy} J")
print(f"Time  : {measurement.time} s")
```

### Finding the optimal GPU power limit

Zeus silently profiles different power limits during training and converges to the optimal one.

```python
from zeus.monitor import ZeusMonitor
from zeus.optimizer import GlobalPowerLimitOptimizer

monitor = ZeusMonitor(gpu_indices=[0,1,2,3])
plo = GlobalPowerLimitOptimizer(monitor)

plo.on_epoch_begin()

for x, y in train_dataloader:
    plo.on_step_begin()
    # Learn from x and y!
    plo.on_step_end()

plo.on_epoch_end()
```

### CLI power and energy monitor

## Getting Started

Refer to [Getting started](https://ml.energy/zeus/getting_started) for complete instructions on environment setup, installation, and integration.

### Docker image

We provide a Docker image fully equipped with all dependencies and environments.
The only command you need is:

```sh
docker run -it \
    --gpus all                  `# Mount all GPUs` \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN         `# Needed to change the power limit of the GPU` \
    --ipc host                  `# PyTorch DataLoader workers need enough shm` \
    mlenergy/zeus:latest \
    bash
```

Refer to [Environment setup](https://ml.energy/zeus/getting_started/environment/) for details.

### Examples

We provide working examples for integrating and running Zeus in the `examples/` directory.


## Extending Zeus

You can easily implement custom policies for batch size and power limit optimization and plug it into Zeus.

Refer to [Extending Zeus](https://ml.energy/zeus/extend/) for details.


## Carbon-Aware Zeus

The use of GPUs for training DNNs results in high carbon emissions and energy consumption. Building on top of Zeus, we introduce *Chase* -- a carbon-aware solution. *Chase* dynamically controls the energy consumption of GPUs; adapts to shifts in carbon intensity during DNN training, reducing carbon footprint with minimal compromises on training performance. To proactively adapt to shifting carbon intensity, a lightweight machine learning algorithm is used to forecast the carbon intensity of the upcoming time frame. For more details on Chase, please refer to our [paper](https://symbioticlab.org/publications/files/chase:ccai23/chase-ccai23.pdf) and the [chase branch](https://github.com/ml-energy/zeus/tree/chase).
