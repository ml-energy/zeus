Zeus is a library for (1) [**measuring**](measure/index.md) the energy consumption of Deep Learning workloads and (2) [**optimizing**](optimize/index.md) their energy consumption.

Zeus is part of [The ML.ENERGY Initiative](https://ml.energy).

## Documentation Organization

- [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md): Instructions on installation and setup.
- [Measuring Energy](measure/index.md): How to measure time and energy programmatically and on the command line.
- [Optimizing Energy](optimize/index.md): How to optimize energy.
- [Research Overview](research_overview/index.md): Overview of the research papers Zeus is rooted on.
- [Source Code Reference](reference/index.md): Auto-generated source code reference for the entire codebase.

We also provide usage [examples](https://github.com/ml-energy/zeus/tree/master/examples) in our GitHub repository.
