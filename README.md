Zeus automatically optimizes the **energy and time** of training a DNN to a target validation metric by finding the optimal **batch size** and **GPU power limit**.

Please refer to our [NSDI’23 publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06102) for details.
Checkout [Overview](https://ml.energy/zeus/overview/) for a summary.

Zeus is part of [The ML.ENERGY Initiative](https://ml.energy).

## Getting Started

Refer to [Getting started](https://ml.energy/zeus/getting_started) for complete instructions on environment setup, installation, and integration.

### Docker image

We provide a Docker image fully equipped with all dependencies and environments.
The only command you need is:

```sh
docker run -it \
    --gpus 1                    `# Mount one GPU` \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN         `# Needed to change the power limit of the GPU` \
    --shm-size 64G              `# PyTorch DataLoader workers need enough shm` \
    symbioticlab/zeus:latest \
    bash
```

Refer to [Environment setup](https://ml.energy/zeus/getting_started/environment/) for details.

### Examples

We provide working examples for integrating and running Zeus:

- Integrating Zeus with Computer Vision
    - [ImageNet](examples/imagenet)
    - [CIFAR100](examples/cifar100)
- [Integrating Zeus with Natural Language Processing](examples/capriccio)
- [Running trace-driven simulation on single recurring jobs and the Alibaba GPU cluster trace](examples/trace_driven)


## Extending Zeus

You can easily implement custom policies for batch size and power limit optimization and plug it into Zeus.

Refer to [Extending Zeus](https://ml.energy/zeus/extend/) for details.

## Carbon-Aware Zeus

The use of GPUs for training DNNs results in high carbon emissions and energy consumption. Building on top of Zeus, we introduce *Chase* -- a carbon-aware solution. *Chase* dynamically controls the energy consumption of GPUs; adapts to shifts in carbon intensity during DNN training, reducing carbon footprint with minimal compromises on training performance. To proactively adapt to shifting carbon intensity, a lightweight machine learning algorithm is used to forecast the carbon intensity of the upcoming time frame. For more details on Chase, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02508) and the [chase branch](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Zeus/tree/chase).
