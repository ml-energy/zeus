    Trades off ETA and TTA based on the value of `eta_knob`.
    The caller is expected to do bound checking for `eta_knob`,
    because `eta_knob` does not change frequently.

    Args:
        energy: Joules
        time: seconds
        eta_knob: Real number in [0, 1].
        max_power: The maximum power limit of the GPU.

    Returns:
        The cost of the DL training job.
