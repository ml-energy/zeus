<h1>An Energy Optimization Framework for DNN Training</h1>
</div>

!!! Success "Join the Zeus Slack workspace!"
    Zeus exceeded 100k+ pulls on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/symbioticlab/zeus)!
    The Zeus team is always happy to chat with Zeus users and help out.
    Reach out to us in the [Zeus Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/zeus-ml/shared_invite/zt-1najba5mb-WExy7zoNTyaZZfTlUWoLLg).

Zeus automatically optimizes the **energy and time** of recurring DNN training jobs by finding the optimal **batch size** and **GPU power limit**.

Please refer to our NSDI’23 [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi23/presentation/you){.external} and [slides](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi23_slides_chung.pdf){.external} for details.
Check out [Overview](overview/index.md) for a summary.

Zeus is part of [The ML.ENERGY Initiative](https://ml.energy){.external}.

## Getting Started

Refer to [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md) for instructions on environment setup, installation, and integration.
We also provide integration examples:

- Integrating Zeus with Computer Vision
    - [ImageNet](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Zeus/tree/master/examples/imagenet){.external}
    - [CIFAR100](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Zeus/tree/master/examples/cifar100){.external}
- [Integrating Zeus with Natural Language Processing and Huggingface](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Zeus/tree/master/examples/capriccio){.external}
- [Running trace-driven simulation on single recurring jobs and the Alibaba GPU cluster trace](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Zeus/tree/master/examples/trace_driven){.external}

## Extending Zeus

You can easily implement custom policies for batch size and power limit optimization and plug it into Zeus.

Refer to [Extending Zeus](extend.md) for details.
