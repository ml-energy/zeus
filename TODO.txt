Completed:

✅ remove cuda_sync and setDevice from gpu, put it back where it belongs 
✅ changed gpu/get_gpu to torch_is_available()-like to make it scalable

✅ Fixed set Persistence Mode, added TODO comment back to where set Persistence mode SYS_admin check was
    ✅ included ability to turn off persistence mode

✅ Fixed set PowerManagementLimit - originally broke API consistency. Added resetPowerManagementLimit function. 
✅ Fixed: To check ensure homogeneous, just convert to set and check len larger than 1 
✅  declare self.gpus as an abstract property to ensure it exists

✅ Fixed names of exceptions
✅ Fall back to ZeusGPUUnknown Error

BIG fixes:
✅ move lru_cache stuff to gpu Class
✅ Fix tests, and remove gpu_indicies

STYLE Fixes:
✅ Module-level docstring in zeus/__init__.py and zeus/device/__init__.py
✅ Fixed docstrings
    ✅  Removed all private attributes from docstrings

✅ made sure signature of __init__ all match
✅ __init__ should come First
✅ mention unit for each method

Questions and notes:
❓ It looks like it is failing on github actions, but it works perfectly locally. I'm not sure what exactly is the issue.


AMD stuff:
- Persistence mode of AMD GPUs?
- CLock types for AMD GPUs?
- HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES?

For example, if you want to do the following:
    ```python
    handle = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(gpu_index)
    pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetPowerManagementLimitConstraints(handle)
    ```
    You can instead do: 


- track credits on AMD gpus
- salloc
