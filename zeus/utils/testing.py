    This class is for testing only. Based on a CSV log file that records the time
    and energy measurements of `ZeusMonitor` measurement windows, users can drop-in
    replace `ZeusMonitor` with this class to replay the measurement windows and
    *fast forward* training and time/energy measurement.

    The methods exposed is identical to or a superset of `ZeusMonitor`, but behaves
    differently. Instead of monitoring the GPU, it replays events from a log file.
    The log file generated by `ZeusMonitor` (`log_file`) is guaranteed to be compatible
    and will replay time and energy measurements just like how the real monitor
    experienced them. Note that in the case of concurrent ongoing measurement windows,
    the log rows file should record windows in the order of `end_window` calls.

        gpu_indices (`list[int]`): Indices of all the CUDA devices to monitor.
