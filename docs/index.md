Zeus is a framework for (1) measuring GPU energy consumption and (2) optimizing energy and time for DNN training.

### Measuring GPU energy

```python
from zeus.monitor import ZeusMonitor

monitor = ZeusMonitor(gpu_indices=[0,1,2,3])

monitor.begin_window("heavy computation")
# Four GPUs consuming energy like crazy!
measurement = monitor.end_window("heavy computation")

print(f"Energy: {measurement.total_energy} J")
print(f"Time  : {measurement.time} s")
```

### Finding the optimal GPU power limit

Zeus silently profiles different power limits during training and converges to the optimal one.

```python
from zeus.monitor import ZeusMonitor
from zeus.optimizer import GlobalPowerLimitOptimizer

# Data parallel training with four GPUs
monitor = ZeusMonitor(gpu_indices=[0,1,2,3])
plo = GlobalPowerLimitOptimizer(monitor)

plo.on_epoch_begin()

for x, y in train_dataloader:
    plo.on_step_begin()
    # Learn from x and y!
    plo.on_step_end()

plo.on_epoch_end()
```

### CLI power and energy monitor

$ python -m zeus.monitor power

Zeus is part of [The ML.ENERGY Initiative](https://ml.energy).


## Getting Started

Refer to [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md) for instructions on environment setup, installation, and integration.
We also provide integration [examples](https://github.com/ml-energy/zeus/tree/master/examples) in our GitHub repository.

## Extending Zeus

You can easily implement custom policies for batch size and power limit optimization and plug it into Zeus.

Refer to [Extending Zeus](extend.md) for details.
