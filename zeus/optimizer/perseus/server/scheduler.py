        have to read this and understand how this generator works.

        The following implementation is a simple example of writing a scheduler using
        this class. `yield` the next frequency schedule, and receive the profiling
        results corresponding to that schedule from the `yield`. `observe` and
        `next_schedule` will run the generator for you.

        In general, this generator should be designed to `yield` schedules infinitely.
        However, if this was written to write a finite number of next schedules and
        raise `StopIteration`, the last schedule cached inside `self._next_schedule`
        will infinitely be returned from the call to `next_schedule`. This can be
        useful when you converge to the optimal schedule and stop the generator, and
        the rest of training will run with the final optimal schedule indefinitely.
