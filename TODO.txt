âœ… remove cuda_sync and setDevice from gpu, put it back where it belongs 
- change gpu/get_gpu to torch_is_available() to make it scalable

- move lru_cache stuff to gpu Class

- Fix set Persistence Mode, add TODO comment back to where set Persistence mode SYS_admin check was
    - include ability to turn off persistence mode
- Fixed set PowerManagementLimit - breaks API consistency
- To check ensure homogeneous, just convert to set and check len larger than 1 
- declare self.gpus as an abstract property to ensure it exists

- Fix names of exceptions
- Fall back to ZeusGPUUnknown Error

BIG BOY:
- Fix tests, and remove gpu_indicies

STLYE:

- Module-level docstring in zeus/__init__.py
- Fix docstrings
    -  Remove all private attributes from docstrings
    -  This docstring should include the following information at the minimum:

            Class hierarchy
            The abstraction provided by this module (most importantly, get_gpus). Basically, how a Zeus-developer should use this module.
            How different GPU vendors are handled
    -  First Line of Docstring should be a single sentence. Then next paragraph goes into more detail
    - "derived from is confusing": I actually don't understand what this means. The phrase derived from is confusing. I think the docstring should rather clearly define NVML GPU indices (which is in the order of physical GPUs attached) and CUDA GPU indices (which is a subset of GPUs influenced by CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) and use these terminologies to indicate whether a certain integer index is NVML or CUDA.

- Check type annotations
- make sure signature of __init__ all match
- __init__ should come First
- mention unit for each method


AMD stuff:
- Persistence mode of AMD GPUs?
- CLock types for AMD GPUs?
- HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES?
